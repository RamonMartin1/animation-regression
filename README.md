# Modeling Global Box Office Revenue for Japanese and American Animated Films

For my [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) regression project, I built two separate linear regression models to predict global box office revenue for American and Japanese animated films, respectively.

## Lessons Learned

Both my models did not perform well as measured by mean absolute errors that were in the tens of millions of dollars. Here are the lessons that I learned, which have helped me improve my subsequent Metis projects. 

1. Think carefully about what data I need to scrape beforehand since re-scraping data can take a long time.
2. Do error analysis throughout the modeling process, not at the very end.
3. Find additional/better data sources if the data source I'm working with is inadequate.
